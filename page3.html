	<p>I was lucky enough to spend 3 days visiting Paris this month! I went with a friend and we were able to see many things while we were there.</p>
		<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p>On our first, we started by visiting <em>Montmartre</em> right away. Our seconf stop was the Eiffel Tower (Check out that beautiful picture!) We ate at a cute bistro overlooking <strong>la Seine.</strong></p>

		<h3>Day 2</h3>
		<p>ON our second day, we went shopping on <em> Avenue des Champs Elysees.</em> Every single person we saw was in the highest of fashion.</p>
<p>After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places! We went to <em>Notre Dame.</em> We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer. After we finished shopping, we visited <em>le louvre.</em></p>

		<h3>Day 3</h3>
<p>The picture below is of me visiting the <em> Arc de Troimphe</em>. It's Huge! We also went to <em>le Musee D'orsary.</em> Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, Van Gogh in person was competely breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the museum also had many sculptures including those bby Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and alfred Barye.</p>
